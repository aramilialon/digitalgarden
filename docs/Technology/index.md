# 💻 IT & Technologies

Technology is at the heart of everything I do. As an IT Manager at Centervue S.p.A. (Revenio Group), I work with cutting-edge technologies daily, transforming from a system administrator into what I call a "real IT manager"—a blend of system architect, network architect, project manager, and sales professional.

## My Tech Stack

### 🌐 **Network Infrastructure**
