# Premises
Whatever is written here contains **spoilers** therefore if you haven't played the entire game... Don't blame me if you get anything you haven't yet seen! 

# Act III.... Really?
I really feel like the third act of this title should have never existed.
I literally cried during the celebrations of the Paintress defeat, after the expeditionaries return to Lumiere, and I felt that the game was already completed since the main objective was achieved. But no, they had to add the "murder" of every people in the *world* because.... Because.
IMHO it really doesn't add any value, after almost 20 hours the game could be already finished, there was no need to *diluite the brooth* (as we say in Italy, meaning to make something longer than it should be) with something that I felt completely out of the narration. The new story had nothing to do with what you've been told until then and it feels as something attached for covering some plot holes.... BOH!

# Is it really a turn-based game?
As someone already mentioned on Youtube [here](https://youtu.be/Ov7ymoZjmtw?si=J3_QGxO_iEmL7aT7&t=43) the parry and/or dodge system is crap. I'm not against it in general (even because the quick-time events like the "press A" button stuff were included in JRPG like Final Fantasy since the 8 [as far as I remember]), but the parry mechanics is more related to others games like Dark Souls or similars. 
I really would have liked to see some options like "Do you want the perry mechanics or not?" in order to accomodate both kind of players, the one that likes to be more active and the more *traditional* ones as I am because it drove me crazy from time to time. And I really didn't liked that many battles were impossible to beat unless you learned that mechanics basically perfectly.
