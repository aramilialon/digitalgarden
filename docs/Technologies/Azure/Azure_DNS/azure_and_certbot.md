title: Automating Certbot with Azure DNS zones
---
# Azure Public DNS Zones & Certbot: yeeeeah......

## Introduction
Because I'm lazy, I want to try to automate Certbot as much as possible in order to fully automate the renewal and applications on a proxy (and subsequent servers eventually).
The idea therefore is to:

* [Install apache and certbot](#install-apache-and-certbot)
* [Create the DNS zones using CNAME structure](#create-the-dns-zones-using-cname-structure)
* [Configure certbot to use Azure](#configure-certbot-to-use-azure)
* [See everything in action](#see-everything-in-action)

_A small detail:_ everything is written for Debian, in case of other distro, 
## Install apache and certbot

Easy then ever

## Create the DNS zones using CNAME structure

## Configure certbot to use Azure

## See everything in action
