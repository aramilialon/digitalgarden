# My personal devlab

## Introduction
Yep, from time to time I need to develop things... Ok, I don't wanna make fun of anyone, I need to try things just for the pleasure to do so from time to time, so I need a mini lab somewhere :P
So starting from that need I wanted to have somewhere a small virtualization farm in order to.... Well, have fun ;)

* Intel NUC
    * **CPU**: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-7100U @ 2.4Ghz
