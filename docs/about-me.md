# Who am I?

<div class="imgcentered"><img src="https://stdigitalgardenmaggiolon.blob.core.windows.net/maggiolonetimages/Personal_images/IMG_20250906_085323.jpg" alt="My picture"></div>

Hello there,

I’m Giorgio Maggiolo, IT Manager in Centervue S.p.A, Revenio Group Oyj’s company, and I would like to welcome you in my website!

This is the very first attempt for me to make a personal website, so please be gentile with me 

Borned in 1989, I’ve always been a tech appasionate, especially for IT and, as basically any real nerd kid, videogames (my father always told me that, when he was playing with the computer when I was a kid, I wasn’t just looking at the screen but actively playing with him).

From the mere system administrator figure I moved “away” due to the jobs I made during these almost 11 years of career, becoming the professionist I’m today, a mix of system and network architect, project manager, sales guy…. A real IT manager!

Some of the technologies/vendors I use the most are:

* Mikrotik
* Ubiquiti
* Azure
* Fortinet
* HPE
* AWS

I'm interested in technologies (IT related specifically), videogames and aviation, so please expect something connected to this here :)
