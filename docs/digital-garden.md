# What is Digital Gardening?

Digital Gardening is about organizing your thoughts in your website / wiki / knowledge base, and sharing it with others. Compared to blogging, your published content is not sorted chronologically and does not have to be perfect. Instead, it is about publishing your thoughts bit by bit and learning in public.

After reading her post, I realized that the concept of Digital Gardening fits my workflow for writing documentation, and was able to further improve my wiki.
